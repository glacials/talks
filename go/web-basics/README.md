# Go Web Basics talk

This is my talk that introduces you to Go from the context of a web service
architecture.

The talk is built with Go's [`present`][present-cmd] tool, with an entrypoint of
`main.slide`. Each directory contains example code used in a slide.

[present-cmd]: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present

## Running it yourself

The talk requires Go to run and view.

```sh
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
present -notes
```

Then open [localhost:3999/main.slide][localhost] in your browser. Press `n` to open
slide notes in a new window.

[localhost]: http://localhost:3999/main.slide

### Usage

Use the arrow keys, enter, or space to navigate with the keyboard. You can also
click the margins of the slides to go back and forward.

Depending on your screen width, parts of the previous and next slides may
reveal too much for your tastes. You can fix this by increasing the font size
of the page (Ctrl+ or âŒ˜+).

For some code snippets, a Run button will appear in the bottom right of the
code snippet. You can click this to run the code. You can also edit the code
while viewing the slide, and the edits will be run instead.

For some slides, nonvital parts of included files like `import` statements are
excluded so that vertical space is conserved. For these slides you will be
unable to edit the excluded parts.

For slides whose runnable code snippets span multiple files, be sure to run the
file with `func main()` in it.

For some slides such as the `gofmt` slide, the demo takes place outside the
slideshow. In these slides, I've placed the command you should paste into your
terminal in order to execute the demonstration.

### Editing

See the documentation for the [`present`][present-pkg] package (not to be
confused with the `present` command linked above) for details on the syntax of
`.slide` files.
